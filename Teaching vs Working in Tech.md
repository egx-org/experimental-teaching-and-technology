# Teaching vs Working in Tech

## Differences

### Adversarial rather than cooperative

I want to help my teammates and students build great things, not nitpick and attack them for mistakes.

### Lots of boring, repetitive work

This is literally the reason many programmers are drawn to tech. The ability to automate and never have to do the same thing multiple times.

### Arbitrarily imposed deadlines are everywhere

Why does this need to be turned in by this date? Because grades need to be in, because we need to be accredited, because the legislature says so, etc.

This also happens in business so we can meet quartely metrics, tie in with marketing capaigns, etc.

In tech it's far more important to take the time to produce high quality code. Getting "something" shipped on time if it's something broken can do tremendous harm and be far, far more costly.

### False superiority is imposed

Instructors are assumed to be "better" than students. While they might know a bit more initially, students who learn quickly may rapidly surpass an instructor in specific areas of knowledge.

While there is artifically imposed hierarchy in tech via management chains and people who have inflated egos, we generally see these things as negative. Tech orgs attempt to stay flat as long as possible and there is growing recognition of toxicity in the industry with "tech bros".

### Finding shortcuts is bad

In school we call this cheating. In business we call this innovation and process refinement.

It is true that there is a moral component that needs to be considered which concerns why the shortcut is being taken and what potential side effects it may cause.

## Similarities

### Metrics are king

Sadly this is the same in many large companies. It is disasterous in both.
