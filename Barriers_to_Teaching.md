# Barriers to Teaching

Current document status: **DRAFT**

A common refrain I run into when doing advisory work is:

    "We can't get people from the tech industry to teach because we can't pay them enough."

While there is a small amount of truth to this, it's a very small part of why it's hard to recruit programmers and cyber security personnel into teaching jobs.

## Context and Disclaimer

This document is written from the standpoint of someone with 25+ years working as a software developer. It assumes the aim of teaching students is to get them ready to work in a software development career. We also assume that ready means that they are proficient and not just basically competent, but able to work effectively in the software industry and comfortable with the tools of the trade and a successful, problem solving mindset.

## Problems

This is a list of the various problems by category that I have either directly experienced or am aware of due to my educational consulting work over the years.

### Friction & Useless work

* Our job is to reduce bullshit work, we don't put up with mindless regulation well.
* We're already busy, most developers and security people work well over 40 hours a week including on call.
* Rigid schedules are problematic when combined with on-call rotations and having to deal with other critical incidents and deploys.
* Attendance, while essential on an assembly line, is near meaningless in the asynchronous world of software development.
* Tracking attendance wastes students and professor's time for very little benefit. (Most attendance keeping seems to be related to preventing fraud related to scholarships and other forms of financial aid.)

### Grading and other pointless metrics

* Metrics are a great way to ruin a project. Many of us have worked in "metrics driven" companies and seen such destruction firsthand.
* Grading is a pain in the ass. Having to adhere to a strict "rubric" does not yield better results when assessing a student's abilities, other than for CYA purposes.
* Grading tends to push instructors to break assignments into small, disintegrated chunks. Most tech work is heavy on synthesis and integration.
* The need to measure limits project scope and integration. This also pushes instructors away from meaningful, student-directed assignments toward meaningless "memorize and repeat" type work e.g. multiple choice tests. This limits us to the lower portions of Bloom's Taxonomy.
* Grading also makes students afraid of mistakes. This leads to a mindset of failure aversion which severely limits students ability to do meaningful tech work.

### Adversarial relationship with students

* Many programmers enjoy working with other smart people on teams. We don't want to manage subordinates (otherwise we'd go the management route), we want to work with colleagues.
* The current student-teacher dynamic is fundamentally adversarial, not collaborative.
  * This makes working with students far higher stress than it should be.
  * This sets up a dynamic that persists into the job market with employees seeing their managers as enemies (which can be true with a bad manager).

### Barriers on interacting with students

* There are lots of regulations like FERPA that restrict how teachers interact with students.
* These make it fraught to share student work with industry connections that may wish to hire such students or to introduce students to contacts that might provide them with opportunities.
* I have seen multiple attendees of hack-a-thons and ranges start careers from such introductions. It's a shame that students in the traditional school system are deprived of the same type of opportunities.

### Better Tech

* Good programmers recognize the importance of good tooling.
* We will often choose projects based on which uses better languages or technologies.
* Schools should be trying out what's next, not teaching what was.
* Will I, as a technology professional, put up with everything in this document to teach an outdated (and in some cases dangerous) technology for a fraction of what I could be making to work with the best technology currently available.
* Schools should not follow business trends when deciding which technologies to teach. Most of these trends are set by marketing departments or other schools, not by the actual needs of industry or the real benefits of available technologies.

* Similar to the [Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis](https://www.thoughtco.com/sapir-whorf-hypothesis-1691924), learning computer languages changes the way students think about solving problems and desigining systems and algorithms. Schools sholud be teaching "mind expanding" languages:

>"A programming language that doesn't change the way you think about programming is not worth knowing."
> â€”Alan Perlis, 1922-1990

### Technological and Administrative Overhead

* Recording and posting classes
* Entering grades and attendance
* Just as "learning styles" have been found to be BS, accomodating students with mixes of live-online, pre-recorded, and remote/in-person makes a huge amount of work for instructors with little actual benefit.
* School emails are constant and not well prioritized

### Focus, Flow State, and Block Scheduling

* School tends to break things into unproductively small chunks. Effective programming is best performed while in flow state. Breaking classes into sub-hour segments all but ensures that students will never be able to enter flow state in the classroom.
* Many classes are setup as pure lecture or combination lecture and work. The problem here is that both models completely prevent students from entering flow state.

### Hand holding vs self-directed work

* A big part of programming is having problem solving and research abilities. Having to hands-hold students that seem to have no desire to acquire either is disturbing.
* In industry it's far more helpful to adopt something like "Don't ask me for help until you've tried 3-5 possible solutions yourself."

## Results and Effects

All of the above contribute to two primary effects:

1. **Avoidance** Tech people avoid taking teaching jobs. Why would we sign up for excessive amounts of beureaucracy for less money?
2. **Burnout**: Those that do take a teaching job out of principle or curiosity, face unnecesarily high rates of burnout.

## Progress

The above problems range from minor to unsolvable, or rather, easy to solve in today's school system to impossible with a full systematic revolution.

### Solvable

* Project based learning
* No testing and quizzes (needless memorization)
* No throw-away work
* Working with real and appropriate tooling (Git, linters, etc.)

### Potentially Solvable

* Working on real, live projects
* Working with better technology (stop teaching what was, teach what's next)
* Teach tech that is an actual improvement, not what's trendy
* Using better technologies

### Impossible In Today's System

* Removing grading in favor of pass/fail (like industry)
* Following topics based on intrinsic motivation
