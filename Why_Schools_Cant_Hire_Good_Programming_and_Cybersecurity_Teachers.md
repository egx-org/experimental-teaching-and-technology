# Why Schools Can't Hire Good Programming and Cybersecurity Teachers

The title is a bit overstated. It's not that there are no good programming/cybersecurity teachers in schools, it's just that the number of them is far below what it sholud be. We'll explore the reasons for this perpetual shortage below.

## Degrees and Certifications

* There's also the rigidity of the curriculum. Being forced to teach things that are not helpful or are frowned upon in industry really kills motivation for teaching. We want to share our knowledge. It is mostly hard won through many, many hours of work and struggle. Being forced to pass on irrelevant or worst-pracitices knowledge instead is deeply insulting and further, contributes to "new grads" being a liability on the team. We must waste our time to teach them how things are actually done.
* Certifications and Degrees. Degrees and certifications range from okay to completely worthless. Many of the best people in industry do not have degrees and certifications. Requiring instructors to have degrees and certifications vastly narrows the pool of talent from which a school can hire, and outright prevents some of the best people from being hireable. My favorite quote from an industry veteran regarding certifications: "I don't see why I should pay someone to test me on technologies that I invented."

## Curriculum and Worst Practices

* Matching curriculum: In the best case, where a knowledgable group of people get together, and all work dilligently to create a good curriculum standard, it frequently takes years for that effort to actually become the new standard. One delay can be the lack of a proper test bank. Even if the standard is done, it may not be able to be implemented until there is a corresponding question bank for tests (true story). This means that even with a responsive curriculum body it's pretty common for curriculum to be years out of date.
* Industry partners. In the worst case, schools sign up for corporate curriculum or buy all of their curriculum from a publisher. Both of these sources have specific, monetary interests that manifest patholocgically in their products. Corporate curriculum tends to lock-in schools to teach only that corporations tools and technologies. It tends to completely omit and ignore open source and other alternatives, and thus provides no discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of various technologiels and techniques and how to choose the appropriate solution in the real world.
* Educational Publishers tend to have similar problems recruiting industry talent to write their wares. Further there are deadlines for publishing and other constraints that mean examples tend not to be drawn from the real world.

## Format of Instruction

* While most schools focus on updating curriculum, the changes that would be far more impactful would be major re-allignment of the structure of teaching from the industrial age to today's age of augmentation and automation.
* Metrics and isolation. Because schools are mostly structured around grades, things are broken into discrete, disconnected pieces that are taught separately. In the real world, problems require synthesis of ideas and integration of different technologies and approaches. Any interesting probrlem in tech will require one or more teams working together, each bringing their expertise to create a solution. This is in stark contrast the "sit down, shut up, and do your own work" format of contemporary schooling.
* Further, getting students to actually collaborate to achieve real goals in industry is made more difficult by their internalizing the individual work ethos. New hires must be broken of this bad habbit and learn how to effectively collaborate with a team.
* Synthesis is difficult/costly to assess. Even though it's the most desired quality, schools de-emphasize it because testing for synthesis is costly and logistically challenging.

## Points of Friction

* Friction is too high. Programmers are very busy. It's common to work absurd hours every week and also to have on-call rotations.
* Beureacuracy and rigidity in teaching.
* Mandatory trainings.
* Grading. We're already saddled with enough BS metrics at work. The last thing we want to do is waste more time grading assignments and applying more BS metrics to our students.
* Schools like to start too early. Respect other chronotypes. Most programmers/cybersecurity people work at night for a reason, fewer distractions.

## Available Alternatives

* Further, programmers are in high demand and even entry level programmers make "FU money". They aren't going to be forced into a job, so if you make it too difficult they'll just take other options.
* Meetup Groups and hack-a-thons. For devs that want to share their knowledge with the next generation, there are already complling ways to do so that don't have a lot of the issues that schools have.
