# Impediments to Learning

This is a list of things that can interfere with learning.

## Access

* Tooling 
  * Can students install what they need?
* Reasonable computer
  * Is the computer fast enough to keep up with the student and run necessary software without lag
  * Is there enough free space on the disk
  * Is the computer reliable
  * Is there a backup strategy, will students lose work?
* Quiet environment in which to achieve flow state
* Multiple monitors: Having documentation and project files side-by-side allows for much faster progress
* Good keyboard
* Has the student had adequate time to familiarize themselves with the computer? This can be problematic with loaner computers. Efficient programming requires a lot of "muscle memory".
