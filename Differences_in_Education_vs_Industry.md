# Differences in Education vs Industry

A list of the common differences between the educational setting and industry.

This will obviously not be true 100% of the time, there are some excellent and innovative instructors and there are also some terrible and regressive workplaces.

| Task | Education | Industry |
| ---- | --------- | -------- |
| Finding a new, faster way to accomplish a goal | Cheating | Innovation |
| Instructions when starting a project | Syllabus with detailed instructions. | Goal based statement.<br />Self-directed research to determine paths forward. |
| Problem Solving | Following detailed instruction, regardless of other options. | Self-directed plan to evaluate best option.<br />Self-directed implementation of best-fit option. |
| Alternate approaches | One preferred solution | Evaluation of various solutions and their relative merits is encouraged |
| Research | Textbook or approved resources | Documentation, DevDocs.io, StackOverflow, YouTube, etc. |
| Research Under Pressure | Not allowed during tests (generally) | Encouraged, no restriction during incidents |
| Getting Assistance | Instructor, sometimes other students | Colleagues, Meetup groups, Live chat communities |
| Assistance under pressure | Not allowed during tests (generally) | Encouraged, team collaboration, calling knowledgeable friends at other businesses |
| Collaboration | Only on group projects | Essential, most work is done on a dev team, collaboration with other teams is common |
| Tooling | Education tooling: Word, Canvas, turnitin.com | VSCodium, Zulip/Slack, GitHub, Static/Dynamic Analysis Tools, Formatters and Linters |
| Assessment | Grade based assessment of how closely you followed the instructions. | Metrics based assessment of solution effectiveness (also not great). |
| Mental Breaks and Decompression | Not allowed during class | Encouraged |
