# Proper Structure for Assignments

Assignments should mimic the actual trade using actual tools.

Do not use "turn it in" or Word Documents. Programming assignments should be turned in via Git.

Assignments should focus on integration, maintenance, and licensing. Teach students to find and use available libraries, not reimplement hasty solutions.

Assignments should be meaningful. Do not have students do useless work like Fibonacci sequences or fizz buzz.
Do things like word counts, sentence reversals, etc. ideally things that make the added capabilities provided by programming obvious to the students.

Grading of programs should be performed via static analysis, dynamic analysis, and testing. Does it run and provide correct results?

Do NOT have students do repetitive work. Good programmers seek to minimize repetitive toil and drudgery. Teaching them to tolerate such things puts them in the wrong mindset and will make them worse at programming.

Do NOT focus on timely submissions. In programming, it is FAR more important to have correct code than code that is turned in on an arbitrary deadline. Other than when fixing a broken production system, time is not usually critical. Even then, hasty fixes can cause tremendous amounts of damage e.g. bad database updates, file deletions, route announcements.
