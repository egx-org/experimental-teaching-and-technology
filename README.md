## Background

I (Elio Grieco) have worked in software development since 1997. During this time I've worked on a wide array of projects from auto-routing, simulation and optimization for analog circuits to websites ranging from small static sites up to working on a core engineering team at Amazon.com.

My early schooling consisted of small Montessori schools where there was a strong community and everyone was genuinely interested and active in the learning process. For 5th grade I made the transition to traditional schooling that proved to be rather disappointing. The contrast between learning styles and switch from a highly collaborative and multi-disciplinary environment to a disturbingly adversarial one was impossible to ignore or accommodate.

Interestingly, my time in the US Army proved to be more similar to my early Montessori schooling than one would assume, albeit with far less freedom.

## Resources

Resources for people trying to understand or enter the field of software development.

* [Successfully Learning to Code](Successfully_Learning_to_Code.md): A list of observations about things that enable or inhibit learning of computer science for people with no prior exposure, applicable to all ages.

### Suggestions

* [Tech Education Reform](Tech_Education_Reform.md): Thoughts about the structural deficiencies in our current educational system and how the mismatch with the needs of technology and knowledge sector jobs makes school more of a liability than an asset in the real world.
* [Proper Structure for Assignments](Proper_Structure_for_Assignments.md): Some suggestions for how to structure effective software development assignments.

### Comparisons

Some documents discussing observations of the differences between teaching technology vs actually building systems in the industry.

* [Teaching vs Working in Tech](Teaching_vs_Working_in_Tech.md)
* [Differences in Education vs Industry](Differences_in_Education_vs_Industry.md)

### Barriers

Analysis of the various reasons that software developers are unlikely or unwilling to take jobs as teachers in tech.

It should be noted that developers frequently volunteer and teach outside the school system, usually with no compensation, in the form of regular meetups, hack-a-thons, and mentoring.
