# Experimental Teaching and Technology

A collection of notes and resources about education reform for teaching STEAM.

## Background

I (Elio Grieco) have worked in software development since 1997. During this time I've worked on a wide array of projects from auto-routing, simulation and optimization for analog circuits to websites ranging from small static sites up to working on a core engineering team at Amazon.com.

My early schooling consisted of small Montessori schools where there was a strong community and everyone was genuinely interested and active in the learning process. For 5th grade I made the transition to traditional schooling that proved to be rather disappointing. The contrast between learning styles and switch from a highly collaborative and multi-disciplinary environment to a disturbingly adversarial one was impossible to ignore or accommodate.

Interestingly, my time in the US Army proved to be more similar to my early Montessori schooling than one would assume, albeit with far less freedom.
